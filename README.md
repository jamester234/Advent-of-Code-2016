# Advent of Code 2016

Solving programming puzzles in the Advent of Code online event that took place starting 25 days before Christmas Day in 2016. 

Learn more about Advent of Code [here](http://adventofcode.com/2016/about). Problems are available [here](http://adventofcode.com/2016).

All scripts are written in Python 3.6, using only built-in functions, constants, types, and exceptions. The sole exception to this rule is the use of the `hashlib` library for days 5, 14, and 17, where the [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) functions in the library were deemed necessary. Where applicable, the input data file is placed in the same directory as the Python script.
